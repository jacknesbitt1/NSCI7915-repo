.............VARIABLES OF INTEREST................
Depth
Duration
Foraging time
Non foraging time
Three categories of vocalisation:
	NumBuzzDescent
	NumBuzzBottom
	NumBuzzAscent
Night/Day
Sprint counts/duration

.............TRANSFORMS...........................

Multiple transforms will be attempted to normalise the data:

Count data (e.g. NumBuzz...) potentially poisson or geometric
Continuous data (i.e. time, e.g. Duration) potentially exponential or lognormal

.............MULTIVARIATE ORDINATION..............

A multivariate ordination will be performed to determine patterns which tend to group together


.............CLUSTER ANALYSIS.....................

A cluster analysis will be performed to recognise any strong patterns in the data

.............CANONICAL CORRELATIONS...............

A canonical correlation analysis MAY be performed to determine relationships amongst variables for a single individual
